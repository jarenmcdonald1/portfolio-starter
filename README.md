# My Personal Portfolio Site

### Why I built the site

I decided to revamp my portfolio using the GatsbyJS framework to build a super fast static site on the Jamstack. I followed the documentation and a few tutorial videos to create the portfolio from the ground up! For each new project posting, I simply create a new MarkDown file that fills in prebuilt fields on a styled template page.

### Improvements

Using GatsbyJS has drastically improved the overall site speed and page-to-page loading speed. With Google Page Speed Insights I am consistently getting above 80 on mobile speeds and above 90 on desktop speeds. 

GatsbyJS also provides built-in SEO improvements which are very noticeable on Google's search engine!

### Tools used to develop:

- Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, XD, After Effects, Media Encoder
- HTML5, CSS, SASS, Git, JavaScript, React, GatsbyJS, GraphQL
- React Bootstrap
